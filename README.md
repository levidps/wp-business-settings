# Variables
Variables is a must-use WordPress plugin that stores site-wide variables.

Variables allows you to store generic information that you might want to use on your site, such as your contact information, postal address, opening hours, and social media links, without having to edit widgets, or hard-coded references in themes.

## Installation
To install Variables copy the contents of the `dist` folder to your WordPress site under `wp-content/mu-plugins/`

Must use plugins will not appear on the Plugins admin page. You can verify that the plugin is installed by visiting the Variables page located under the WordPress Settings menu.
